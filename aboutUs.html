            GS Keys was established in May 2019 by George Oddes and Steven Rayd.
            </p>
            <p>
            The company was set up after identifying that many people were being overcharged, for services rendered. 
            <p>
            It appeared that nobody could do a complete job on site without removing parts and in some cases never returning to complete the work. This is where we saw a gap in the market, an opportunity to be different and ahead of the rest.
            </p>
            </p>

            <p> 
            GS Keys is a complete one stop mobile workshop that comes to its customer's to supply new keys and attend to their every need as quikly, efficiantly and cost effectivly as possible.
